\vspace*{2pt}
\begin{innerlist} \item Aim of the project was to compare the performance of the Machine learning methods on the Electromyographic (EMG) data of hand gestures. Data from seven gestures that were repeated for six times each by one subject was obtained using 8 channel Myo armband at 200 Hz data-rate for an average of 1.1s. Four time-domain features including mean absolute value (MAV), zero crossing (ZC), sign slope change (SSC) or turn count (TC) and Willison amplitude value (WAV) were computed from the raw EMG data for each channel. Four classification models including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were used for training and testing. Finally, training accuracy  and testing accuracy of the four methods were compared. KNN produced the best accuracy of 98.4\% during training while SVM produced the best accuracy of 96.06\% during testing. Overall, SVM produced the best accuracy of 95.1\% and 96.06\% during both training and testing respectively.

One of the most popular algorithms for motion estimation is block matching algorithm due to its simplicity in implementation on hardware. The goal of this project was to design and implement an end-to-end motion estimator including High Description Langugue (HDL) design, timing and area simulation, redesign to improve timing and area, and finally generate the General Description Scheme (GDS-II) file that could subsequently be used to print on reticle/photomask for integrated circuit (IC) chip fabrication targeting 32/28 nm CMOS technology.
