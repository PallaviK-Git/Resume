\textbf{Comparison of Machine Learning Methods on EMG data of Hand Gestures using Matlab} \\ 
Course: \textbf{Neural Machine Interface} \\
\vspace*{-32pt} \begin{flushright} Jan 2021 � May 2021 \end{flushright}
\vspace*{-2pt} 
\begin{innerlist} \item Aim of the project is to compare the performance of the Machine learning methods on the Electromyographic (EMG) data of hand gestures. Data has been obtained using 8 channel Myo armband at 200 Hz data-rate for an average of 1.1s. Seven gestures repeated for six times by one subject are chosen for the study. Four time-domain features namely mean absolute value(MAV), zero crossing(ZC), sign slope change(SSC) or turn count (TC) and Willison amplitude value (WAV) are extracted from the raw EMG data for each channel. Four classification models namely Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor are used for training and testing. Finally accuracy of both training and testing of the methods are compared. KNN provided the best accuracy of 98.4\% during training while SVM provided the best accuracy of 96.06\% during testing. Overall SVM provided the best accuracy of 95.1\% and 96.06\% during both training and testing respectively.

Course: \textbf{Embedded Systems} \\
\vspace*{-32pt} \begin{flushright} Aug 2021 � Dec 2021 \end{flushright}
\vspace*{-2pt} 
\begin{innerlist} \item This project contains a basic network stack and shell for the Tiva C-series microcontrollers. The shell contains the following commands:
   \subitem \emph{ping} - Pings and IPv4 address.
   \subitem \emph{arp} - Looks up the IPv4 address of a MAC address.
   \subitem \emph{raw} - Toggles raw printing of Ethernet frames.
   \subitem \emph{ipconfig} - Displays IPv4 configuration.
   \subitem \emph{setip} - Sets IPv4 address.
   \subitem \emph{setsub} - Sets IPv4 subnet.
   \subitem \emph{setgw} - Sets IPv4 gateway.
   \subitem \emph{help} - Prints available comands.
   \subitem \emph{uptime} - Reports time that Tiva has been on the network.
\end{innerlist}  \vspace*{10pt}

\textbf{ASIC Implementation of Motion Estimator in 32/28nm CMOS} \\ 
Course: \textbf{Advanced Digital Design} \\
\vspace*{-32pt} \begin{flushright} Aug 2021 � Dec 2021 \end{flushright}
\vspace*{-2pt} 
\begin{innerlist} \item Motion estimation is one of the key components of high compression video codecs. The most popular algorithm for motion estimation is block matching algorithm due to simple hardware implementation. The goal in this project is to design the motion estimator from HDL to GDS in the 32/28nm CMOS technology.
